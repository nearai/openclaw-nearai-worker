# Production Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.prod and fill in your values

# ============================================
# Required Configuration
# ============================================

# Admin token for Management API authentication (32 hex characters)
# Generate with: openssl rand -hex 16
ADMIN_TOKEN=

# Your server's public IP address or hostname
# Users will access their instance at: http://{OPENCLAW_HOST_ADDRESS}:{gateway_port}
# SSH access: ssh -p {ssh_port} agent@{OPENCLAW_HOST_ADDRESS}
# Example: http://54.123.45.67:19001, ssh -p 19002 agent@54.123.45.67
OPENCLAW_HOST_ADDRESS=localhost

# ============================================
# Optional Configuration
# ============================================

# OpenClaw container image to use for user instances
# Default: openclaw-nearai-worker:local (built locally)
# OPENCLAW_IMAGE=openclaw-nearai-worker:local

# Management API listen address
# Default: 0.0.0.0:8080
# LISTEN_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8080

# Rust log level for management API
# Options: trace, debug, info, warn, error
# RUST_LOG=info

# ============================================
# Security Notes
# ============================================
# 1. The management API requires Bearer token authentication (ADMIN_TOKEN)
#    All API requests must include: Authorization: Bearer {ADMIN_TOKEN}
#
# 2. NEARAI_API_KEY is provided per-user in the POST /users request
#    Each user has their own API key for their container
#
# 3. Consider additional protection in production:
#    - Use firewall rules to restrict management API access
#    - Or bind to localhost and use SSH tunnel
#
# 4. Consider using a secrets manager for ADMIN_TOKEN
#
# 5. Ensure firewall allows ports:
#    - 8080 (management API)
#    - 19001-19999 (user containers: gateway + SSH ports)
