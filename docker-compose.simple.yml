# Simple Multi-Tenant OpenClaw Deployment (Direct Port Access)
# 
# This compose file sets up ONLY the Management API.
# No Traefik - users access containers directly via IP:port.
# Only the Management API has Docker socket access.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy env.prod.example to .env.prod and configure
#   2. docker compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up -d
#   3. Use the management API to create user containers

services:
  # ============================================
  # Management API (Rust/Axum)
  # ============================================
  # This is the ONLY container with Docker socket access.
  # It creates/manages user containers programmatically.
